    Sometimes humans built weird things.
    Our Robots wants to use the ancient circular canon loading system.
    The system is looked as numbered pipes aligned by circle.
    There is a rotating mechanism behind these pipes with canons.
    But the system is old (pirate age) and some canons are broken.

    The loading automaton has a program with pipe numbers where it should place cannonballs and we can not change this.
    But we can rotate the backend mechanism and this way we can change the correspondence between pipes and canons.
    We should find all ways how we can rotate the backend mechanist, that all loaded balls will be placed in the working canons.
    The loading automaton loads all balls simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
    The pipes are numbered from 0 to N.
    The initial position of the backend mechanism are represented as an array with 1 and/or 0.
    Each element describe a canon behind the pipe. 0th element describe 0th pipe.
    1 is a working canon (a good canon) and 0 is a broken (a bad canon).<br>
    You know pipes numbers where will be loaded balls (sometimes it loads several cannonballs in one canon).
    Your goal is find all ways how to rotate the backend mechanism by clockwise, that all balls will get in the working canons.
    Rotating is described as a number - how many units you should rotate by clockwise.
    The result should be represented as a list of numbers (variants) in the ascending order.
    The case when you don't need to rotate are described as 0 (but don't forget about other variants).
    If it's not possible to find a solution, then return [].
</p>
<p>
    For example, the initial state is [1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1] and pipes numbers are [0,1].
    If you rotate the mechanism by 1 or 8 units, then all balls which are be placed in the 0th and 1st pipes will be in canons.
